## Welcome! I'm Antoine.                                                            

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice](https://sp2.upenn.edu/). I hold a PhD in Economics from [CORE/LIDAM, UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam)  obtained in June 2025 as part of the [European Doctoral Program](https://www.edpqe.eu/). 

I am on the 2025-2026 **academic job market** and available for interviews at ASSA and EEA meetings. 

My research fields are public economics, labor economics and social choice theory. I study the welfare consequences of labor market policies using both theory and empirics.
