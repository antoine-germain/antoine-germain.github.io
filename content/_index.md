## Welcome! I'm Antoine.                                                            

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice](https://sp2.upenn.edu/). I hold a PhD in Economics from [CORE/LIDAM, UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam)  obtained in June 2025 as part of the [European Doctoral Program](https://www.edpqe.eu/). 

I am on the 2025-2026 **academic job market** and available for interviews at ASSA and EEA meetings. 

My research fields are public economics, labor economics and social choice theory. My research evaluates public policies when (1) agents have heterogeneous tastes and (2) labor markets are imperfect.
