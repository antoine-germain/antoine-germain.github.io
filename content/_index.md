## Welcome! I'm Antoine.



I am a E.G. de Barsy Research Fellow at the [F.R.S-F.N.R.S.](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/le-fnrs/missions-du-fnrs) and a PhD candidate in economics at CORE/[LIDAM](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam), UCLouvain.  I am also part of the [European Doctoral Program in Economics](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/core/edp.html).

My supervisor is [François Maniquet](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=cQR8M6IAAAAJ&hl=fr).

**During Spring 2023, I'll be visiting the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics). Hit me up if you're around!**

My research focuses on public and welfare economics. I'm interested in normative issues related to redistribution policies. 

<!-- I combine insights from the theories of **optimal taxation** and fairness in order to link some normative considerations with practical policy recommandations on the taxation of labour income, capital and bequests. -->

<!---- In 2020, I obtained a MRes in Economics from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/programs/master+of+science/Economic+and+Social+Sciences/Program+Structure/) and the [Economics School of Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/faculties/espo/esl/research-master-in-economics-120.html). My master [thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/2078.1/thesis:26601) in optimal taxation theory was written under the supervision of Profs. [François Maniquet](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=cQR8M6IAAAAJ&hl=fr) (UCLouvain) and [Nicola Pavoni](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=ijJrvG8AAAAJ&hl=it) (Bocconi).   -->
