  abstract : > 
      Philosophers diverge on whether redistributive transfers to able-bodied inactives would be fair. This paper evaluates their claims. Labor markets feature multidimensional heterogeneity in leisure preferences, disutilities of participation, wages and home production. The social objective champions the ethics of equality of opportunity while upholding the Pareto principle. In the Mirrleesian second-best, it turns out that welfare analysis is reduced to a sufficient statistic. Its empirical application suggests that an inactivity benefit would not be welfare-improving in most high-income countries. Overall, the equity gains of introducing a basic income with respect to equality of opportunity are tenuous, whatever its efficiency costs.

- title : "2. Working time regulations and monopsony power [NEW!]"
  pdflink : "https://antoine-germain.github.io/research/germain_WTR.pdf"
  abstract : >
       This paper studies the consequences of working time reductions when labor markets may be monopsonistic. In a general equilibrium model that unbundles labor inputs into hours and jobs, I show that the marginal utility of a small working time reduction is zero in perfect competition but may be positive in monopsony. However, the policy increases wage rates in perfect competition but decreases monopsonistic wage rates. I test these predictions empirically by evaluating the first-ever working time reduction in Belgium: the maximum 9h workday in 1910's coal mines. I find that the policy had sizable negative effects on profits, employment and earnings. To assess welfare, I generalize the findings to a directed search model with matching frictions where firms have heterogeneous productivity. Utilitarian welfare is expressed in terms of a sufficient statistic whose application to the 1910 reform suggests that the value of leisure was particularly large.

  abstract : >
       This paper builds axiomatically a measure of consumer welfare in a general consumption space where agents may differ in their preferences, endowments and prices. The axioms reflect the ethics of equality of opportunity: unequal budgets create welfare-relevant inequalities but heterogeneous preferences do not. When combined with an appropriate cross-economy robustness condition, these axioms single out a consumer welfare measure. Like aggregate consumption in national accounts, this measure sums up individual expenditure functions. Unlike national accounts, these functions are evaluated at a common price vector for all individuals. I show that standard measures of cost of living, standards of living, and purchasing power parity can be modified to reflect welfare as equality of opportunity without additional data.

  #  How can we tax savings, be they wealth, estate or property, in a fair way? I study redistributive taxation of labour incomes and savings in a model where agents are heterogeneous in their discount rates, preferences for leisure, productivities and capital stocks. The Paretian social objective is pinned down by axioms championing two fairness principles: (1) agents should not be penalized for their propensity to save but (2) should be compensated if they cannot save. In turn, the social welfare function prioritizes a well-being measure that is orthogonal to the saving rate but favors the hardworking poors with the smallest capital stock. In the second best, there is a threshold (below) above which savings taxation is (un)desirable. Overall, the paper provides a fairness rationale for the use of exemption thresholds in the taxation of wealth, estate, or property but also for energy or housing policies.
