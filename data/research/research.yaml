- title : "1. Basic income versus fairness: optimal taxation with inactive agents"
  book : "Draft available soon"
  abstract : > 
    We study redistributive taxation when there are inactive, unemployed and employed agents. In a model with both heterogeneous preferences and unequal skills, labour market inactivity arises because of home production or disutility of participation in the formal sector. The social objective is characterized by fairness axioms championing the ethics of equality of opportunity while respecting the Pareto principle. Applying this objective in a Mirrleesian environment, we show that the optimal inactivity benefit (1) decreases with the economy's average wage rate, (2) supplements rather than crowds out the traditional safety net, and (3) is likely to be negative empirically in most developed countries. Overall, the results underline an unexpected conflict, but not an impossibility, between basic income and equality of opportunity.

- title : "2. Fair savings taxation"
  book : "Draft available soon"	
  abstract : >
    How can we tax savings, be they wealth, estate or property, in a fair way? I study redistributive taxation of labour incomes and savings in a model where agents are heterogeneous in their discount rates, preferences for leisure, productivities and capital stocks. The Paretian social objective is pinned down by axioms championing two fairness principles: (1) agents should not be penalized for their propensity to save but (2) should be compensated if they cannot save. In turn, the social welfare function prioritizes a well-being measure that is orthogonal to the saving rate but favors the hardworking poors with the smallest capital stock. In the second best, a (suboptimal) reform is desirable if and only if the smallest subsidy is increased for the minimum wage-earners whose savings lie below some threshold. At the optimum, this threshold acts a critical point (below) above which savings taxation is (un)desirable. Overall, the paper provides a fairness rationale for the use of exemption thresholds in the taxation of wealth, estate, or property but also for energy or housing policies.
